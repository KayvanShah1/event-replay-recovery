The referenced page is a Markdown document discussing **Event Recovery and Replay Systems**. It explores strategies and best practices for handling events in distributed systems, focusing on ensuring data consistency and system resilience.

**Key Topics Covered:**

- **Event Recovery:** Techniques to restore system state after failures, ensuring that no events are lost and that the system can continue processing without data inconsistencies.

- **Event Replay:** Methods to reprocess events, which is crucial for scenarios like system failures, data corrections, or rehydrating state in distributed systems.

- **Architectural Considerations:** Best practices, design patterns, and tools commonly used in implementing event recovery and replay systems.
